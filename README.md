### Installation

Follow these steps in order to install the addon:
1) Download this directory as a zip file.
2) Extract the zipped directory into the directory `Interface/AddOns/` (Can be found where you installed world of warcraft and then in e.g. the `_classic_` directory)
3) Currently the directory is incorrectly named. Once extracted you will have a directory called `Mallard-AddOn-main` which needs to be renamed to just `Mallard`.
